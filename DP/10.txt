Question 10:

The most important part is, in Q10, '*' represents ZERO OR MORE OF THE PREVIOUS ELEMENT(NOT PLURAL)!
For example, 'aab' matches 'c*a*b*' because the latter one has 0 c, 2 a's and 1 b.
And also, for the function isMatch(string s,string p), the symbol '*' and '.' only appears in string p!!

Two methods:
1.Recursive
2.DP

Basic Recurrence:


Other attentions for DP:
For 2d array, we have to make it [m+1][n+1] instead of [m][n]
